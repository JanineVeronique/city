    <b><strong><h1>About Port- of- Spain</h1></strong></b>
    <p>Port- of- Spain is the capital city of Trinidad and Tobago.
    It is the second largest city in the country. Port- of- Spain
  is also the financial and administrative centre of the country.
The main buildings in the city are the Red House which is where Parliament
is held, the National and Performing Arts Centre where main cultural events are held,
and the Twin Towers where the Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago resides.

The weather is this city is quite often very bipolar. On average temperatures range from the highest 98.6 degrees F and lowest
58. 3 degrees F. Being a city in the Caribbean the sun would be scorching hot one
day and there would be pouring rain to the point of massive flooding the next day.
These odd cycles of weather are thus shown on the previous page.  </p>
